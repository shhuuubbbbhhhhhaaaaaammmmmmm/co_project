# co_project
This repository contains the code for Computer Organisation(CO) group project of Btech 1st year IIITD. students in the group: 
Sarthak Singh : 2022457 
Shubham : 2022448
Sachin Maurya : 2022424
Sankalp Raj : 2022445

We have converted "Assembler.py"

the code consists of 4 main parts:
first, the dictionary of opcodes and redister adress, having the name as key and it's binary as value.
there is also a dictinary of variables and lables

then there is a function which converts a single instruction to machine code, 


then there is a for loop iterating definitions, 
for use later for  assigning variable adresses and label adresses

lastly there function A B C D E F G

errors in the code are checked throughout each of the steps mentioned

Function allowed the group to create a versatile assembler that could be used for a variety of tasks.
The group members worked together effectively to create a functional assembler. Each member made a significant contribution to the project, and their work was essential to the success of the project.
